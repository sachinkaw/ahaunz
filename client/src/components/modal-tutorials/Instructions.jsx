          <p>
            This tool has been designed for <b>use on a computer</b>
            <br />
            If you are on a mobile the look and feel will not be great, but it
            will still work and we will be working to make this better soon
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            We have designed this tool so anyone who has access can create,
            explore and update whananu whakapapa records. <br />
            To do this we have built in some core features and will continue to
            add more as we find time. As this prototype is a beta version please
            note you will need to create a different whakapapa record for each
            of your different whƒÅnau lines.
            <br />
            <b>Pan : </b> Click anywhere and hold and move the mouse, to move
            the tree around
            <br />
            <b>Zoom : </b> Use the mouse scroll to Zoom in or out. You can also
            double click to Zoom in <br />
            <b>Add : </b> Right click on any person and select Add. You can can
            a parent, child, or sibling.
            <br />
            <b>Update : </b> Right click on any person and select Update to edit
            their information <br />
            <b>Delete : </b> Right click on any person and select Delete to
            remove a person and their children from the tree. Please be careful
            when deleting someone as that information cannot be brought back and
            will have to be added again. <br />
            <b>Sort : </b> When adding a person, use order of birth to sort the
            name in order from 1st born - last born. <br />
