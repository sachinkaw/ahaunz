        <b>Preamble</b>
      </h5>
      <p>
        With respect to the inherent rights that we as Māori have by virtue of
        our inalienable relationships with the land, water and the natural
        world, we assert that: <br />
        • Data is a living tāonga and is of strategic value to Māori. <br />
        • Māori data refers to data produced by Māori or that is about Māori and
        the <br />
        environments we have relationships with. Maori Data includes but is not
        limited to:
        <br />
        o Data from organisations and businesses
        <br />
        o Data about Māori that is used to describe or compare Māori collectives
        <br />
        o Data about Te Ao Māori that emerges from research
        <br />
        • Māori data is subject to the rights articulated in the Treaty of
        Waitangi and the UN’s Declaration on the rights of Indigenous Peoples ,
        to which Aotearoa New Zealand is a signatory.
        <br />
        • Data Sovereignty typically refers to the understanding that data is
        subject to the laws of the nation within which it is stored.
        <br />
        • Indigenous Data Sovereignty perceives data as subject to the laws of
        the nation from which it is collected.
        <br />
        • Māori Data Sovereignty recognises that Māori data should be subject to
        Māori governance.
        <br />
        • Māori Data Sovereignty supports tribal sovereignty and the realisation
        of Maori and Iwi aspirations

        <b>Purpose</b>
      </h5>
      <p>
        The purpose of Te Mana Raraunga is to enable Māori Data Sovereignty and
        to advance Māori aspirations for collective and individual wellbeing by:
        1. asserting Māori rights and interests in relation to data,
        <br />
        2. ensuring data for and about Māori can be safeguarded and protected,
        <br />
        3. requiring the quality and integrity of Maori data and its collection,
        <br />
        4. advocating for Māori involvement in the governance of data
        repositories,
        <br />
        5. supporting the development of Māori data infrastructure and security
        systems,
        <br />
        6. supporting the development of sustainable Māori digital businesses
        and innovations.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Where necessary, Te Mana Raraunga will utilise the expertise of its
        members to provide Māori data governance functions over relevant
        datasets in the absence of mandated Māori governance entities. Te Mana
        Raraunga will support the establishment of appropriate protocols for iwi
        authority over data.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Te Mana Raraunga will advocate for resourcing to support the development
        of capacity and capability across the Māori data ecosystem including:{" "}
        <br />
        1. Data rights and interests. Establishing the nature of Māori rights
        and interests to government collected administrative data, survey,
        census and research data derived from indigenous tāonga are central to
        realising aspirations in the Mataatua Declaration, the WAI262 claim, and
        the UNDRIP. Articulating these rights and interests in an intellectual
        property framework is necessary to realise commercialisation
        opportunities and benefit sharing agreements for hapū, iwi and/or Māori
        entities .<br />
        2. Data governance. There is a wealth of data pertaining to Māori
        individuals, whānau, households, hapū, iwi, entities and te Taiao that
        is collected by the state as part of the Official Statistics System
        (OSS), crown agencies and government organisations, through commercial
        transactions, social media, telecommunications (including satellites)
        and other means. Only a small proportion of these data sources are
        currently accessible to Māori for our own purposes and benefit. Māori
        involvement in data governance and data management is essential to
        ensure data is used for projects that support beneficial outcomes for
        Māori.
        <br />
        3. Data storage and security. As more businesses and entities have moved
        to cloudbased models of data storage, this has raised concerns around
        the security and privacy of data that are stored offshore, and the legal
        and privacy frameworks that the data are subject to, including the issue
        of data sovereignty. TMR supports the development of Māori data
        infrastructure and security systems to support the realisation of Māori
        data sovereignty
        <br />
        4. Data Collection, Access and Control: Māori should be involved in
        decisions about the collection of and access to Māori data, analysis and
        interpretation. Use of data for research should also be consistent with
        frameworks for Māori research ethics (i.e. Te Ara Tika). Using data
        requires that data is made available in a usable form and that we have
        the workforce who can be actively engaged in the design, collection,
        processing, analysis and dissemination of data to meet our own needs.

      <h5>
        <b>Guiding principles</b>
      </h5>
      <p>
        Te Mana Raraunga recognises the need to advance discussions about Māori
        Data Sovereignty at both governance and operational levels. The work of
        Te Mana Raraunga will support the realisation of rangatiratanga,
        kotahitanga, manaakitanga and kaitiakitanga.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Whanaungatanga and Whakapapa:</b> Whanaungatanga denotes the fact
        that in Māori thinking and philosophy relationships between man, Te Ao
        Turoa (the natural world) and spiritual powers inherent therein, and
        Taha Wairua (spirit) are everything. Whakapapa evidences those linkages
        and identifies the nature of the relationships. <br />
        <b>Rangatiratanga:</b>Rangatiratanga speaks to the hapū, iwi/Māori
        aspiration for selfdetermination, to be in control of our own affairs
        and to influence those taking place within our iwi boundaries. This is
        especially true for activities that have the potential to affect our
        people (ngā uri whakaheke) or our environment (whenua/moana).
        Rangatiratanga can be expressed through leadership and participation.
        Data supports the expression of Rangatiratanga and Rangatiratanga can be
        expressed through data in terms of the OCAP©4 principles of ownership,
        access, control and possession. <br />
        <b> Kotahitanga:</b> Kotahitanga speaks to a collective vision and unity
        of purpose while recognising the mana of rangatira from individual hapū
        and iwi. The foundations of kotahitanga can be found in our whakapapa
        and reflected in our relationships with each other. It is important that
        we make space to identify our collective aspirations for indigenous data
        sovereignty and advocate for activities that benefit all Māori. <br />
        <b> Manaakitanga:</b> Manaakitanga can be expressed through the
        responsibility to provide hospitality and protection to whānau, hapū,
        iwi, the community and the environment. The foundations of manaakitanga
        rely on the ability of Māori to live as Māori, to access quality
        education, to have good health, to have employment opportunities and to
        have liveable incomes. Ethical data-use has the potential to contribute
        greatly to Māori aspirations. <br />
        <b> Kaitiakitanga:</b> Kaitiakitanga speaks to the hapū, iwi
        responsibility to be an effective steward or guardian and relates to
        actions that ensure a sustainable future for all people. Underpinning
        our existence is the need to protect and enhance Māori knowledge and
        practices, to strengthen whānau, hapū and iwi and to create sustainable
        futures. Kaitiaki have a social contract and are responsible to the
        communities they serve. Identifying appropriate data guardians and the
        principles by which they will operate is a key consideration.
